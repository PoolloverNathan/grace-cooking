Ever gotten this strange error message?
```
Unrecognized command help. The command does not exist, or you aren't allowed to run it. Run /help for help.
```
Well, I have the solution! Over the last few days, I have been writing the `/help` command to view help pages, like `commands` and `html`. Pages that start with `#` will be hidden from non-admin users, while pages that start with `%` will not show in the list but can be typed in manually. What a helpful command!
